The notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

**Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier**<br>
The notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

**Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network**<br>
The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

**Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features**<br>
The notebook features.ipynb will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

# Assignment 2
**Q1: Multi-Layer Fully Connected Neural Networks**<br>
The notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will have you implement fully connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several popular update rules.

**Q2: Batch Normalization**<br>
In notebook BatchNormalization.ipynb you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully connected networks.

**Q3: Dropout**<br>
The notebook Dropout.ipynb will help you implement dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

**Q4: Convolutional Neural Networks**<br>
In the notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

**Q5: PyTorch/TensorFlow on CIFAR-10**<br>
